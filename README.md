# Find A Bank App!

## Deployment

I've deployed the app to Heroku, you can access it here -> `https://murmuring-basin-71542.herokuapp.com/`

## Development

Use docker-compose to run the app in dev mode

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
open up `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes

1. The server is written in plain js, I didn't want to add unnecessary complexity to implement one route...
2. My production DB is MongoDB atlas.
